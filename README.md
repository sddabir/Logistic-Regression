# Logistic-Regression

Projects based on linear regression from the Supervised Machine Learning course I completed in January 2023. From this course I learned to: • Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn. • Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including logistic regression
